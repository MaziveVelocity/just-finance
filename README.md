# Just Finance

## Description

This application allows the user to keep track of spending and income. 
When the user brings up the site they are presented with a graph and two inputs. 
The user then enters in the name of the transaction and the amount. To submit the
transaction the will either hit add funds or subtract funds depending on the transaction. 
Once this is done it is added to the graph. Now there has been an added feature that
allows the user to submit these transactions while offline as well. If the user is offline
it will locally save the data and once reconnected will be sent to the data base for long
time storage.
